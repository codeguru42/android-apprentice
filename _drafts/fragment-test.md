tags: android testing unit-testing robolectric

In this article, we will learn how to write unit tests for a `Fragment` subclass. This is a continuation of a series of articles about testing with [Robolectric][1]. If you want to learn about the basics of testing with Robolectric, read the [first article][9] in this series.

The source code for all of the apps in this series can be found on [GitHub][2]. The final version of the Android Studio module used in this article is in the `fragment-test` subdirectory at the [`fragment-test` tag][3].

Prerequisites
==

In this article, I assume that you are already familiar with Android development and unit testing. You should be comfortable with Android Studio, the Android API (especially Activities and Fragments), and JUnit 4. To review these tools, see the following links:

* [Android Studio][4]
* [Android API Training][5]
* [Android API Guides][6]
* [Android Activities][7]
* [JUnit 4][8]
